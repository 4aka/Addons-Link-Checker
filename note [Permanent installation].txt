Permanent installation (subscription required)

To install .xpi as a regular extension, it must be signed through Mozilla Add-ons (AMO):

1. Register an account at addons.mozilla.org
2. Download the ZIP/XPI archive.
3. Mozilla will check and issue a signed .xpi.
4. After that, the file can be installed without errors.
